    <h1>Abtraction Test in javascript.</h1>
    <h2>An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users. In
        other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.</h2>
    <h1>Constructor in javascript :-</h1>
    <h2>A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. In JavaScript, a
        constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword. The purpose of a constructor is to
        create a new object and set values for any existing object properties.</h2>
    <h1>Asynchronous and Synchronous in javascript :-</h1>
    <h2>Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. Tasks can
        run simultaneously. Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation is dependent on
        the completion of the one before it.</h2>
